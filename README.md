# Google Summer of Code 2025

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual program sponsored by Google that offers stipends to university students for working on open-source projects during the summer. In GSoC, students can contribute to open-source software development, gain experience, and make a lasting impact on the open-source community.

This repository contains projects and contributions made during Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025. It includes contributions across multiple organizations, each with several projects that students can work on. 

## How to Participate in GSoC

If you want to participate in Google Summer of Code, here's everything you need to know:

### 1. GSoC Overview

Google Summer of Code connects university students with open-source organizations. Participants work on open-source software projects over the summer, contributing to projects that are meaningful to them and the open-source community. 

The program is split into three phases:
1. **Application Period**: Organizations list their project ideas, and students submit applications for specific projects.
2. **Community Bonding Period**: Once selected, students spend a few weeks getting familiar with their community and project before the official coding period begins.
3. **Coding Period**: Students develop their projects, submit progress reports, and receive mentorship from project maintainers.
4. **Evaluation Period**: The mentors evaluate students' progress, and if everything goes well, the project is merged and the stipend is awarded.

### 2. GSoC Timeline

**The timeline for GSoC 2025** includes the following important milestones:
- **Application Period**: Students can submit applications for projects.
- **Community Bonding Period**: Mentors and students interact and set expectations.
- **Coding Period**: The official period where students develop their projects.
- **Midterm Evaluation**: A checkpoint to review progress.
- **Final Evaluation**: The final assessment to determine if the project was completed successfully.

Each organization may set its own timeline within the framework provided by Google.

### 3. How to Apply

If you're interested in participating in GSoC, follow these steps:

- **Research Organizations and Projects**: Visit the official GSoC website to explore the organizations that are participating in GSoC 2025. Each organization will list their projects, including the skills required for each.
  
- **Select a Project**: Choose a project that aligns with your interests and skills. Understand the requirements and the expected outcome for the project.

- **Write Your Proposal**: Once you’ve chosen a project, you need to write a detailed proposal. The proposal should explain:
  - Why you’re interested in the project.
  - Your technical background and experience.
  - A detailed plan of action, including project milestones, timelines, and any resources you need.

- **Submit Your Application**: After you have drafted your proposal, submit it to the relevant organization on the GSoC website. Make sure to meet the application deadlines.

### 4. The Community Bonding Period

Once you’re accepted as a student, you enter the **Community Bonding Period**. This phase helps you get prepared for the coding period:
  - Meet your mentors and get familiar with the tools and community.
  - Set up your development environment.
  - Finalize your project plan and ensure you understand the requirements of your project.
  - Build relationships with fellow contributors.

This period lasts a few weeks and typically starts a few weeks before the official coding phase.

### 5. The Coding Period

The **Coding Period** lasts from June to August, during which students work on their projects. This is the most active period, and during this time, you'll:
  - **Get Mentorship**: You’ll have regular meetings with your mentor, who will guide your progress, provide feedback, and help you overcome challenges.
  - **Submit Weekly Progress Reports**: Some organizations require weekly status reports to track your progress. Make sure to update your mentor and community regularly.
  - **Stick to Milestones**: Follow the timeline you’ve set out in your proposal. Ensure you complete each milestone on time.
  - **Collaborate with the Community**: Engage with the broader community of contributors to get feedback and collaborate.

### 6. The Evaluation Period

There are typically two evaluations during GSoC:
  - **Midterm Evaluation**: Around the halfway point, mentors will assess your progress and ensure everything is going smoothly. If you’ve completed your milestones and your mentor is satisfied, you’ll proceed with your work.
  - **Final Evaluation**: At the end of the program, mentors will evaluate your final project and determine if you’ve met the goals outlined in your proposal. If you pass, you will receive your stipend.

### 7. Contribution and Earning Stipend

To earn your stipend, you must:
  - Actively contribute to the project.
  - Submit regular progress reports as required by the mentors and organization.
  - Complete milestones and deliverables on time.
  - Get positive evaluations from mentors.
  - Finish your project with high-quality, open-source code.

GSoC offers a stipend for students who successfully complete the program. The stipend is paid in installments, with the first payment after the midterm evaluation and the final payment after the successful completion of the project.

### 8. Final Submission

Once your project is finished:
  - Submit a final report summarizing your work and the outcomes of the project.
  - Ensure that all code is properly documented and available to the community.
  - The organization will mark the project as complete, and your work will be celebrated within the open-source community.

### 9. Post-GSoC

Even after GSoC ends, you are encouraged to:
  - Continue contributing to the project you worked on.
  - Engage with the community and help other students during the next GSoC round.
  - Work with your mentors to improve and extend your project.
